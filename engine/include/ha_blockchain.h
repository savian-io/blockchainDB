/** @file ha_blockchain.h

    @brief
  The ha_blockchain engine is a stubbed storage engine for blockchain purposes
  only; it does nothing at this point. Its purpose is to provide a source code
  illustration of how to begin writing new storage engines; see also
  /storage/blockchain/ha_blockchain.cc.

    @note
  Please read ha_blockchain.cc before reading this file.
  Reminder: The blockchain storage engine implements all methods that are
  *required* to be implemented. For a full list of all methods that you can
  implement, see handler.h.BC_T

   @see
  /sql/handler.h and /storage/blockchain/ha_blockchain.cc
